I have an interdisciplinary background and the aspiration to develop machine learning-driven simulation methods to promote drug discovery and answer critical life chemistry problems.


# üíª Experience

- **Development of a Flexible-Receptor Molecular Docking Method** *2/2023-present*

  Undergraduate Researcher, Instructed by Prof. Yi Qin Gao, Peking University
  
  - Developed DSDPflex, a GPU-accelerated flexible-receptor docking program derived from DSDP; implemented receptor side-chain sampling, scoring, and gradient optimization on GPU (CUDA).
  - Designed and implemented specific optimizations for flexible-receptor tasks that help address some observed issues in current methods, improving the docking accuracy significantly.
  - Constructed a new cross-docking dataset for comprehensive evaluations of flexible-receptor docking methods, more diverse and challenging than commonly used sets, and tested DSDPFlex with mainstream methods.
  - Validated that DSDPFlex outperformed AutoDock Vina in flexible-receptor docking accuracies while presenting ‚àº250-fold acceleration (‚àº1 second per task on 1 GPU).
  - Authored a paper on this project. (preparing for submission)


- **Comparison of the Electrostatic Fields of Chorismate Mutases** *08/2023-09/2023*

Summer Research Intern, Instructed by Prof. Anastassia N. Alexandrova, UCLA (remote)

  - Investigated the previous research on the catalytic mechanism of Chorismate Mutase (CM) and learned to use Amber.
  - Studied and retrieved representative enzyme structures from different CM families that were suitable for intra- and inter-class comparison.
  - Prepared TSA-binding protein structures for subsequent molecular dynamics simulations, with AlphaFold prediction, structure alignment, and molecular docking for various systems.

**Investigation on Deep Learning-Based Molecular Docking Models** *09/2022-01/2023*

Undergraduate Researcher, Instructed by Prof. Yi Qin Gao, Peking University

  - Learned the fundamentals of deep learning, graph neural networks, and generative models to under- stand the principles of the latest docking models.
  - Investigated and tested deep learning-based molecular docking methods, e.g., GNINA, EquiBind, DiffDock.
  - Presented an in-detail report about DiffDock at the group meeting, which was the state-of-the-art model.
