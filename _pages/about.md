I have an interdisciplinary background and the aspiration to develop machine learning-driven simulation methods to promote drug discovery and answer critical life chemistry problems.


# üíª Experience

- **Development of a Flexible-Receptor Molecular Docking Method** *11/2022-present*

  Undergraduate Research, Instructed by Prof. Yi Qin Gao
  
  - Developed DSDPflex, a GPU-accelerated flexible-receptor docking program derived from DSDP; implemented receptor side-chain sampling, scoring, and gradient optimization on GPU (CUDA).
  - Designed and implemented specific optimizations for flexible-receptor tasks that help address some observed issues in current methods, improving the docking accuracy significantly.
  - Constructed a new cross-docking dataset for comprehensive evaluations of flexible-receptor docking methods, more diverse and challenging than commonly used sets, and tested DSDPFlex with mainstream methods.
  - Validated that DSDPFlex outperformed AutoDock Vina in flexible-receptor docking accuracies while presenting ‚àº250-fold acceleration (‚àº1 second per task on 1 GPU).
  - Authored a paper on this project. (preparing for submission)
